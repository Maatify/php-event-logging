## Security Scope

This package is a framework-agnostic standalone Composer package for event logging domains.

Security reports are especially relevant when they involve:

* Unsafe handling of logged metadata or payload data
* SQL injection or unsafe query construction inside package-owned repositories
* Incorrect fail-open / fail-closed behavior in logging domains
* Exposure of sensitive data through DTO serialization or query output
* Broken domain isolation between logging domains
* Incorrect use of host-provided identifiers
* Dependency-related vulnerabilities affecting package runtime behavior

---

## Out of Scope

The following areas are generally outside the security scope of this package unless the issue is caused directly by this package:

* Host application authentication or authorization
* Host application routing, controllers, middleware, or UI
* Host application database credentials or PDO configuration
* Infrastructure, server, firewall, or deployment misconfiguration
* Incorrect permissions applied by the consuming application
* Manual modification of database tables outside the package contract

Host applications are responsible for securely configuring their own runtime, database connection, access control, and operational environment.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is confirmed:

1. The issue will be reviewed and triaged.
2. A fix will be prepared and tested.
3. A patched version will be released when appropriate.
4. A security advisory may be published if the vulnerability affects released versions.
