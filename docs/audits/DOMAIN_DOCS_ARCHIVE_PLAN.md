## 3. Safe Archive Batch

The following files have been successfully moved to `docs/archive/domain-docs/`:

* `docs/archive/domain-docs/AuditTrail/CANONICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/AuditTrail/CHECKLIST.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/AuditTrail/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/BehaviorTrace/CANONICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/BehaviorTrace/CHECKLIST.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/BehaviorTrace/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/DiagnosticsTelemetry/CANONICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/DiagnosticsTelemetry/CHECKLIST.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/DiagnosticsTelemetry/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/SecuritySignals/CANONICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/SecuritySignals/CHECKLIST.md`
* `docs/archive/domain-docs/SecuritySignals/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`

## 4. Merge Before Archive — Completed

The Merge-First Batch is now completed. The following files remain in `src/` for now and may be archived in a later dedicated batch only if desired:

* `src/AuditTrail/PUBLIC_API.md`
* `src/BehaviorTrace/PUBLIC_API.md`
* `src/DiagnosticsTelemetry/PUBLIC_API.md`
* `src/SecuritySignals/PUBLIC_API.md`

## 5. Keep Active

These domain overview files serve as the primary introduction to each namespace and must remain active in their current location:

* `src/AuditTrail/README.md`
* `src/AuthoritativeAudit/README.md`
* `src/BehaviorTrace/README.md`
* `src/DeliveryOperations/README.md`
* `src/DiagnosticsTelemetry/README.md`
* `src/SecuritySignals/README.md`

## 6. Architect Decision Needed

No files currently require an architect decision. `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` has been successfully resolved and archived.

## 7. Recommended Next Step

**Archive Complete:** The Safe Archive Batch has been executed. The `PUBLIC_API.md` files' Merge-First Batch is complete. `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` is resolved and archived. There are no remaining domain docs archive blockers.
