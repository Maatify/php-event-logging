# FINAL RELEASE AUDIT

*Note: This is a historical audit document from before Phase J. Any references to the internal `ClockInterface` or exceptions inheriting directly from `RuntimeException` are preserved here for historical context only. The repository now uses `Maatify\SharedCommon\Contracts\ClockInterface` and `Maatify\Exceptions\Exception\System\SystemMaatifyException`.*

## Verdict
PASS

## Executive summary
The `maatify/event-logging` package has successfully completed all roadmap phases and is now fully ready for release as a standalone Composer library. The architecture strictly isolates the six event logging domains with clear boundaries. All previous issues regarding generic components and database table naming conventions have been resolved. The final code consistency and schema verifications prove compliance with the Maatify module standards. Validation commands (syntax checking and static analysis) pass without any issues.

## Roadmap verification
- Phase 1 (Fix Database Naming): Completed.
- Phase 2 (Documentation Cleanup & Schema Artifact Alignment): Completed.
- Phase 3 (Code Consistency Review): Completed.
- Phase 4 (Validation Gate): Completed.
- Phase 5 (Final Release Audit): Completed with this document.

## Standalone package readiness
- **Composer package name:** `maatify/event-logging`
- **PSR-4 namespace:** `Maatify\EventLogging\`
- **Host application references:** None. There are no framework or host dependencies, nor references to `Athar Admin`, `App\`, `Slim`, or any host-project runtime dependencies.
- **Public documentation:** Accurate, consistent, and ready for release.

## Architecture compliance
- **Domains:** Strictly isolated into six domains (AuthoritativeAudit, AuditTrail, SecuritySignals, BehaviorTrace, DiagnosticsTelemetry, DeliveryOperations).
- **Common primitives:** The `Common` module only contains utility primitives (`SystemClock`, `ClockInterface`, `UrlSanitizer`, `MetadataSanitizer`).
- **Generic components:** There are no `GenericLogger`, `GenericDTO`, `GenericRecorder`, or shared generic log tables.
- **Isolation:** Domain boundaries remain completely isolated from one another.

## Command/DTO/repository boundaries
- **Commands:** Used strictly as public record input contracts.
- **DTOs:** Utilized as output/read models or internal transfer objects between recorders and writers. They are correctly implemented as `final readonly` and use `JsonSerializable` where needed.
- **Recorders:** Responsibly construct write DTOs internally based on commands or method parameters.
- **Repositories:** Strictly handle SQL persistence, querying, and hydration. They contain no display formatting or domain policy decisions.

## Failure semantics
- **AuthoritativeAudit:** Strictly adheres to fail-closed behavior (throws `AuthoritativeAuditStorageException`).
- **Non-authoritative domains:** Correctly employ try-catch blocks and fallback PSR loggers to ensure fail-open behavior. `record()` and `recordCommand()` handle `Throwable` gracefully without leaking errors.

## Database/schema readiness
- **Canonical table names:** All schemas use the standard `maa_event_logging_*` prefix as intended.
- **SQL schema filenames:** Aligned properly with docs and roadmap names.
- **Schema Index:** `schema/README.md` correctly catalogs domain-local schema files and canonical table names.
- **Old references:** Completely removed. No old table names exist in code or public docs except in historical audit/roadmap context.

## Documentation readiness
All requested documents (`README.md`, `PUBLIC_API.md`, `EVENT_LOGGING_MODULE_REFERENCE.md`, `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/audits/*`, `docs/roadmap/*`, `schema/README.md`) are thoroughly updated, aligned, and consistent with current application state and requirements.

## CI/validation readiness
- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/phpstan.yml` correctly targets only path-filtered event logging files.
- **Validations:** All CLI validation commands verify code structure and functionality without reporting any errors.

## Validation commands and exact results
- **composer validate:**
```
./composer.json is valid
```
- **composer install:**
```

## Blockers
None.

## Non-blocking notes
The structure adheres perfectly to standalone module principles and follows the requested fail-closed/fail-open semantic design accurately.

## Final release decision
PASS. The package is ready for release.
