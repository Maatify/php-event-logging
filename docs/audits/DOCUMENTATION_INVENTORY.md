|---|---|---|---|---|
| `./CHANGELOG.md` | Root / Package Docs | Active | Tracks changes between releases |  |
| `./EVENT_LOGGING_PACKAGE_REFERENCE.md` | Core | Active | Current Runtime truth; primitive cursor contracts | Post-v1 pagination wrappers are documented as superseded experiments. |
| `./README.md` | Root / Package Docs | Active — Current Runtime Overview | Main entry point and package overview | Contains current guardrail wording: explicitly not self-contained, no generic logger/DTO/recorder/table, no SQLite examples. No cleanup required unless wording becomes ambiguous. |
