# Admin Read Binding Reference Alignment

**Status:** PASS
**Auditor:** Jules
**Release Readiness Impact:** None (Gate remains passed)

## Overview

This audit verifies that the `maatify/event-logging` library provides sufficient primitive read/query support for host admin panels to integrate with, while strictly respecting standalone package boundaries and aligning with the `EVENT_LOGGING_MODULE_REFERENCE.md`.

## Checklist against EVENT_LOGGING_MODULE_REFERENCE.md

- [x] **Standalone Package Boundaries:** Package remains host-agnostic, expecting host to wire dependencies.
- [x] **Framework-agnostic Design:** No framework bindings, auto-wiring, or container integration assumptions present.
- [x] **Explicit Domain Logging:** Read/query API strictly follows domain isolation.
- [x] **No Generic Components:** No `GenericReader`, `GenericLogViewer`, `GenericQueryRepository`, or shared cross-domain query services.
- [x] **No Host App Assumptions:** The package does not assume the presence of UI, admin routes, permissions, or host application tables.

## Primitive Query Support Confirmation

The package successfully provides the necessary foundations for host admin integration through isolated primitives in each domain:
- [x] **Domain-specific `QueryInterface`:** Present for all 6 domains.
- [x] **Domain-specific `QueryDTO`:** Exists for all 6 domains with proper typing.
- [x] **Domain-specific `ViewDTO`:** Exists for all 6 domains.
- [x] **Domain-specific `QueryMysqlRepository`:** Present and fully implemented.
- [x] **Domain-specific Filters:** Available on each `QueryDTO` (e.g., AuthoritativeAudit correctly omits `requestId`).
- [x] **Cursor Pagination:** Supported via `cursorOccurredAt`, `cursorId`, and `limit`.
- [x] **Stable Ordering:** Configured correctly (`ORDER BY occurred_at DESC, id DESC`).
- [x] **Safe JSON Decode:** Handled seamlessly, where corrupt metadata/payload arrays return `null` instead of failing the whole row.
- [x] **Domain-specific Storage Exceptions:** Read actions throw isolated, specific storage exceptions (e.g., `AuditTrailStorageException`), never swallowing failures.

## Host Responsibilities Confirmation

It is confirmed that the following responsibilities strictly remain outside the package, ensuring the architecture remains isolated:
- [x] Admin controllers
- [x] Admin routes
- [x] Middleware
- [x] Permissions / RBAC
- [x] Admin UI / Views
- [x] Exports
- [x] Analytics / Dashboards
- [x] Labels / Localization
- [x] Actor display resolution
- [x] Framework / Container bindings

## Documentation Clarity Check

- `docs/integration/ADMIN_READ_USAGE.md` clearly explains how a host admin panel should utilize query repositories.
- The documentation explicitly states that the package does not provide admin controllers, UI dashboards, routes, or permissions.
- There is no confusing wording implying that an admin module, an admin module interface, or a CRUD interface exists within the library. The documentation strictly utilizes the terms "primitive read/query contracts" and "foundations for administrative viewing capabilities."

## Conclusion & Recommendation

The current architecture and documentation fully align with `EVENT_LOGGING_MODULE_REFERENCE.md`. The domain isolation and read constraints are strictly maintained.

**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The `maatify/event-logging` library is robustly separated from host administrative concerns.
